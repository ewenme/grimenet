### about

*GRIMENET* is an app for exploring the social networks within [UK Grime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grime_(music_genre)). Each node is an artist, each edge (or link) is a collaboration between artists documented on [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/), from the genre's formation in the early 2000s through to the present day.

Grime is well-known for it's competitive nature, owing to the captivating art of "clashing" and ever-precious mic time on pirate radio sets over-flowing with excitable MCs. This goes hand-in-hand with an undeniable community spirit, vital to the evolution of the sound and growth of the scene.. This work is a tribute to this scene interdependence, and is also intended as an artifact to aid future understanding of how pre-internet, localised music scenes operated and grew organically.

> “Scenius stands for the intelligence and the intuition of a whole cultural scene. It is the communal form of the concept of the genius.” (Brian Eno)
