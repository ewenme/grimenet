### about

*GRIMENET* is an app for exploring the social networks of UK Grime. Each node is an artist, each edge (or link) is a collaboration between artists as recorded on [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/), from the genre's formation in the early 2000s through to the present day.

Grime is well-known for it's competitive streak, owing to a long-standing ritual of "clashing" peers and elusive mic time on claustrophobic pirate radio sets. Such tradition is synonymous with undeniable community spirit, vital to the evolution of the sound and growth of the scene. This project is a tribute to the scene's interdependence, and is also intended as an artifact to aid future understanding of network effects within pre-internet, hyper-local music scenes.

> “Scenius stands for the intelligence and the intuition of a whole cultural scene. It is the communal form of the concept of the genius.” (Brian Eno)
